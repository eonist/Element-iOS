## Goals for Element-iOS:
- Styles that query a cache. To speed up style retrieval (research required)
- Rock-solid padding, margin, floating etc. W/ documentation (no lose ends)
- Struct, Enum, duplets, and if let style code. Figure out why nil coalescing is so bad
- Read more books from objc.io to include more syntactic swift sugar (browse other books for pre-research-sweep)
- Dedicated iOS Utils Lib: swift-utils-iOS (svg,graphics,event,file - not array and math etc)
- Use cocoaPods from the start (research required)
- Use .framework from the start (this will likely speed up build times) (research required)
- override var's for OOP getters and setters
